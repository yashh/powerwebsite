                <h1><strong>Terms of Service</strong></h1>
                <br>
                <h2><strong>Effective: December 31, 2024</strong></h2>
                <br>
                This Power Cash Merchant Agreement (the “Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you (“Merchant”, “you” and “your”) and Golden Order, Inc. (hereafter, “the Company,” “we,” “our” or us”), and governs your use of Power Cash payment services (“Payment Services”), offered by the Company. As the individual using the Payment Service, you acknowledge and agree that you have authority to bind the business or entity and that such business or entity accepts the terms of this Agreement (the “Control Person”).
                <br><br>
                PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. AS OUTLINED BELOW, THEY INCLUDE A MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER WHICH (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS) REQUIRE ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE RESOLVED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN BY A JUDGE OR JURY IN COURT. You also agree to comply with the following additional policies and any policies referenced within (“Policies”):
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Privacy Policy</li>
                    <li>Terms of Service (“Power Cash Terms”)</li>
                    <li>Acceptable Use Policy</li>
                    <li>Consent to Receive Electronic Disclosures (E-Sign Disclosure and Consent)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                We may amend this Agreement at any time with notice that we deem to be reasonable under the circumstances, by posting the revised version on our website, or by communicating it to you through the Payment Services (each a “Revised Version”). Your continued use of the Payment Services after the posting of a Revised Version constitutes your acceptance of such Revised Version. Any Dispute that arose before the changes will be governed by the Agreement in place when the Dispute arose.
                <br><br>
                We may provide disclosures and notices required by law and other information about your Account (defined below) to you electronically, at any time of day, including by posting it on our website, pushing notifications through the Payment Services, or by emailing it to the email address listed in your Account. Electronic disclosures and notices have the same meaning and effect as if we had provided you with paper copies. Such disclosures and notices are considered received by you within twenty-four (24) hours of the time posted to our website, or within twenty-four (24) hours of the time pushed or emailed to you. If you wish to withdraw your consent to receiving electronic communications, contact Power Cash Support. If we are not able to support your request, you may need to terminate your Account.
                <br><br>
                If any inconsistency exists between the Power Cash Terms and this Agreement, then the terms of this Agreement shall control in connection with your use of the Payment Services.
                <br><br>
                <h2><strong>Power Cash Merchant Account</strong></h2>
                As the Control Person, you must submit all relevant information regarding your business or entity and all beneficial owners to register for a Power Cash Merchant Account (“Power Cash Account” and “Merchant Account”). We will verify your business information, identity, and the identity of all beneficial owners of the business on our own behalf and to facilitate certain of our partners, including Global Innovations Bank and our other banking partners, in meeting their own obligations.
                <br><br>
                <h2><strong>Registering, Opening, and Using your Merchant Account</strong></h2>
                To register, open, and use a Merchant Account, the Company will require that you submit certain information about yourself, your business or entity, and all beneficial owners to the Company (“Merchant Information”). Information you are required to provide regarding your businesses include the business name, employer identification number (EIN), business address, business phone number, and the type of business you are conducting. For individuals, both you and all beneficial owners, the information you are required to provide include name, address, phone number, date of birth, social security number, email, and the ownership percentage related to the business. You represent and warrant that all Merchant Information you provide the Company to register, open, and use is true and accurate, and you agree to keep all Merchant Information current.
                <br><br>
                <h2><strong>Validating and Authenticating Your Business and Identity</strong></h2>
                You hereby authorize the Company, directly or through the Company's use of third parties, to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate your identity, authenticate your identity and Merchant Information, and comply with laws and regulations, including without limitation Know-Your-Customer (“KYC”) and Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) laws. This may include asking you for further information or documentation about your Merchant Account usage or identity, requiring you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address, mobile phone number or financial instruments, your business’s Employer Identification Number (“EIN”), or verifying your information against third-party databases or through other sources.
                <br><br>
                In connection with your use of the Payment Service, you may not refuse to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cooperate in an investigation concerning activity that potentially violates the law or the Terms,</li>
                    <li>Provide confirmation of your identity, or</li>
                    <li>Provide confirmation of any information you provide us.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                If you decline to provide us with the information that we request or if we cannot verify your identity to our satisfaction (in our sole judgment and discretion) for any reason, then your Account will be suspended and you will not be able to use your Power Cash Balance to make payments or use certain Payment Services. In addition, we reserve the right to change the account type or suspend or terminate the Account or access to certain Payment Services of anyone who provides inaccurate, untrue, or incomplete information.
                <br><br>
                <h2><strong>Assigning Agents</strong></h2>
                You will have the ability to assign individuals an account that can utilize the Payment Services on behalf of Your business or entity (an “Agent”) by entering the individual's legal name and email address (“Agent Information”). Once you assign an individual as an Agent, you hereby acknowledge and agree that the Agent has authority to utilize the Payment Services on behalf of Your business or entity and they are as well bound to the terms of this Agreement on behalf of your business or entity. You represent and warrant that all Agents are employees of your business or entity, and all Agent Information you provide the Company to register, open, and use is true and accurate, and you agree to keep all Agent Information current.
                <br><br>

                <h2><strong>Power Cash Balance</strong></h2>
                When you first open your Merchant Account you will be REQUIRED to link an external, U.S.-issued bank account (an “Eligible Bank Account” as defined below) to utilize the Payment Services. By linking an Eligible Bank Account to your Merchant Account, you are hereby representing, under penalty of perjury, that you are the legal owner of that Eligible Bank Account.
                <br><br>

                <h2><strong>General</strong></h2>
                <strong>Functionality:</strong> Your balance consists only of the funds you have received in your Merchant Account by leveraging the Payment Services (your “Power Cash Balance”).
                <br><br>
                <strong>Authorization for Refunds:</strong> Each time you or your Agent instruct us, through your Merchant Account, to initiate a Refund (as defined in section III.A “Refunds”), you authorize us to immediately debit your Eligible Bank Account to the Company at the time of the Refund for the amount instructed.
                <br><br>

                <h2><strong>Transferring Funds to Your Bank Account</strong></h2>
                <strong>Transfers to Your Bank Account:</strong> You may electronically transfer funds from your Power Cash Balance to an Eligible Bank Account (“Withdraw”). By selecting an Eligible Bank Account as your deposit source you are requesting that we settle an electronic transfer to your bank account. The Company will settle these electronic transfers (via the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) of NACHA - The Electronic Payment Association (“NACHA”)) to your Eligible Bank Account in the amount you instruct, and you will not be able to cancel the ACH transfer. Such transfer to your Eligible Bank Account via ACH will typically arrive within three (3) business days.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Limitations:</strong> The Company may limit how many Withdrawals you can initiate from your Merchant Account to your Eligible Bank Account and the amount of funds you can transfer in a single transaction. We reserve the right to delay or further limit such transfers at our discretion to protect the Company or a third party against the risk of reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties, and other liability. In addition, you may not transfer funds from your Power Cash Balance to your Eligible Bank Account to evade a payment investigation. If you attempt to transfer your Power Cash Balance while we are conducting an investigation, we may hold your funds at our discretion to protect the Company or a third party against the risk of reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties, and other liability. We also may defer or redirect payout or restrict access to your funds as necessary to comply with applicable law, subpoena, or court order, or if requested by any governmental entity. You will remain liable for all obligations related to your Account even after the Account is closed.
                <br><br>

                <h2><strong>Treatment of Funds</strong></h2>
                While you have funds in your Merchant Account, your Power Cash Balance may be commingled and held with other participants’ funds in one or more pooled accounts at one or more banks by us on your behalf and for the benefit of you and others holding balances (each a “Pooled Account”). We have sole discretion over the establishment and maintenance of any pooled account. We will not voluntarily make funds available to our creditors in the event of bankruptcy or for any other purpose. You will not receive interest or any other earnings on any funds that we handle for you. As consideration for using the Payment Services, you irrevocably assign to us all rights and legal interests to any interest and/or other earnings that may accrue or are attributable to our holding of your Power Cash Balance in a Pooled Account.
                <br><br>

                <h2><strong>Payment Services</strong></h2>
                Our Payment Service lets you accept payments from Power Cash customers for your goods or services. You acknowledge and agree you will not use your Merchant Account for receiving funds for personal, non-commercial purposes.
                <br><br>

                <h2><strong>Your Authorization for Settlement of Proceeds and for the Company to Recover Funds</strong></h2>
                In connection with the Payment Services, you authorize us to act as your agent for the purposes of holding, receiving, and disbursing funds on your behalf. Your authorization permits us to settle the proceeds of each payment you receive, less any applicable fees (“Proceeds”). Your authorizations will remain in full force and effect until the later of closure or termination of your Merchant Account, or the disbursement of all funds held on your behalf. Our receipt of transaction funds satisfies your customer’s obligations to make payment to you. We will remit to you funds actually received by us on your behalf, less amounts owed to us, subject to any Chargeback provisions (as defined in Sections IV.A).
                <br><br>

                In addition, by using the Payment Services, you authorize us to recover funds from you in accordance with these Payment Terms, the Power Cash Terms and any other agreement you have with us (“Recovery Authorizations”).
                <br><br>

                <h2><strong>Unsupported Activities and Businesses</strong></h2>
                The Company prohibits certain activities and business types to keep our clients and bank safe. These activities include a business purpose of or any entity with funds derived from or to be used for the following:

                <br>

                <h2><strong>Our Fees</strong></h2>
                You agree to pay the applicable fees disclosed to you when you create your Merchant Account.
                <br><br>
                All fees are charged at the time we process a transaction and are deducted first from the transferred or collected funds. Subject to the Power Cash Terms and this Agreement, we reserve the right to change the fees upon reasonable advance notice. All Balances and all fees, charges, and payments collected or paid through the Payment Services are denominated in US dollars.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Power Cash’s Fees Applicable as of December 31, 2024 are as follows:</strong>
                <ul>

                <br>

                <h2><strong>Requests for Additional Information and Inspection</strong></h2>
                The Company may request additional information from you at any time. For example, the Company may ask you to present invoices from your suppliers, a government-issued identification such as a passport or driver’s license, a business license, or other information. The Company may also ask for permission to inspect your business location. If you refuse any of these requests, your Merchant Account may be suspended or terminated.
                <br><br>

                <h2><strong>Cash for Business Account History</strong></h2>
                When a payment is made to your Merchant Account, it will be reflected in your Power Cash activity feed. Summaries of your Power Cash Merchant Account activity, including monthly statements, are available through the app or on the Power Cash website. Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Compiling and retaining permanent records of all transactions and other data associated with your Merchant Account and your use of the Payment Services.</li>
                    <li>Reconciling all transactional information that is associated with your Merchant Account.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                If you believe that there is an error or unauthorized transaction activity associated with your Merchant Account, you must contact us immediately.
                <br><br>

                <h2><strong>Chargebacks</strong></h2>
                <strong>Your Liability for Chargebacks:</strong> There may be times when your customer may contest the transaction (“Chargeback”). If a transaction is reversed or is subject to a successful chargeback for any reason, you are responsible for the full amount of the payment plus any fees. We reserve the right to deduct the amount (including any applicable fees) from the balance of your business profile.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Our Collection Rights for Chargebacks:</strong> If you have pending chargebacks, we may delay payouts to you. If you lose a chargeback, you agree to pay us the full amount plus any fees, and that we can debit your linked bank account to recover money you owe.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Excessive Chargebacks:</strong> If you have - or if we think you are likely to have - too many chargebacks, we may add restrictions to your account.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Contesting Chargebacks:</strong> Chargebacks are time-sensitive and can involve many parties, so we need your help to contest chargebacks quickly and diligently.
                <br><br>

                <h2><strong>Indemnity</strong></h2>
                You will indemnify, defend, and hold us and our processors (and our respective employees, directors, agents, affiliates, and representatives) harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, losses, damages, judgments, tax assessments, penalties, interest, and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or in connection with:

                    <li>Your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any right of privacy, publicity rights, or Intellectual Property Rights.</li>

                <h2><strong>Binding Individual Arbitration</strong></h2>
                <strong>General:</strong> You and the Company agree that any and all Disputes, except those that are resolved informally or brought in a small claims court, will be individually arbitrated by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same individual damages and individual relief that a court can. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, MASS ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Pre-Filing Requirement to Attempt to Resolve Disputes:</strong> Before an arbitration is commenced, you and the Company agree to attempt to avoid the costs of formal dispute resolution by giving each other a full and fair opportunity to address and resolve a Dispute informally. Both parties recognize that this is an important requirement, and that breach of this requirement would be a material breach of the Terms.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Scope of Arbitration:</strong> If we and you are not able to resolve the Dispute by informal negotiation or in a small claims court, all Disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”) administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) according to the NAM Comprehensive Rules and Procedures.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Arbitration Fees:</strong> In accordance with the NAM Rules, the party initiating the arbitration (either you or us) is responsible for paying the applicable filing fee. For purposes of this arbitration agreement, references to you and the Company also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors, and assigns, as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of the Services.
                <br><br>

                <h2><strong>Choice of Law</strong></h2>
                This Agreement and any Dispute will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, as set forth above, and by California law and/or applicable federal law, without regard to its choice of law or conflicts of law principles.
                <br><br>
